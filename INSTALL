NagBody: Installation
################################################################################

1. Clone NagBody_lectures git repository

git clone https://github.com/rodriguezmeza/NagBody_lectures.git

2. Change to NagBody_lectures/NagBody_pkg and execute

make -f NagBody install_dirs

3. Read the corresponding code Readme file in directory Readmes to get installation instructions of a particular NagBody code.

4. The first steps to do in order to start compiling a NagBody code are:

To create one binary code. In the Readmes folder there are several Readme files. Readme them to follow the making process. For example, "nbody_n2":

make -f NagBody install_nbody_n2

In the ÒbinÓ directory you will have the Ònbody_n2Ó code. Then go to tests directory and

../bin/nbody_n2

Last command run the nbody_n2 code and you will see in the terminal some output. Read the manual to see how to use the code:

man ../man/man1/nbody_n2.1

ThatÕs it.


5. Could be useful to have NagBody_pkg binaries set in the environment path of your computer. Change to your HOME:

cd $HOME

6. Modify your profile (it can be ".profile" for Mac OS X or ".bashrc" for Linux):

For a Mac OS X:

cp .profile profile_nagbody_bak
cat profile_nagbody_bak NagBody_lectures/NagBody_pkg/env_config/profilerc > .profile

For a Linux:

> cp .bashrc bashrc_nagbody_bak
> cat bashrc_nagbody_bak NagBody_lectures/NagBody_pkg/env_config/profilerc > .bashrc

7. Open a new terminal to refresh your environment. 

7. Change to NagBody_pkg directory:

> cd NagBody_lectures/NagBody_pkg

8. Tune the file "Machines/machine.inc" or "Machines/pmachines.inc" in order to use the right compilers and libraries. 

For now, in Mac OS X:

PLPLOT:

Description of the installation steps for the plplot package needed for the visualization codes and in the readme file in the folder Readmes/additional_libs.

The plplot libraries are needed to generate nplot2d, analysis_XXX visualization codes.

NOTE: If plplot libraries can be installed using apt-get (linux) or Ports (Mac OS X) or by other means then just make the following link:

cd $HOME/NagBody_pkg/local
ln -s /usr plplot

Las line if the one in case that in that directory was installed plplot library. In Mac OS X using ports it goes in /opt/local.

Once you are set, the steps below are not necesary!! 

To install plplot manually do (make sure xwin, pdf and eps or ps drivers were installed!!)

cd NagBody_lectures/NagBody_pkg/NagBody_sources/additional_libs/plplot-5.15.0

(directory name may change with the version)

cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/NagBody_lectures//NagBody_pkg/local/ -DENABLE_DYNDRIVERS=ON -DPLD_psttfc=OFF -DPLD_plmeta=OFF -DENABLE_python:BOOL=OFF -DENABLE_lua:BOOL=OFF -DPLD_luac=OFF .. 2>&1 | tee cmake.out

make 2>&1 | tee make.out
make install 2>&1 | tee make_install.out

Review log (*.out) files to see the status of each one of the installation process. If there were no errors you are set and can remove installation directory:

cd ..
rm -fR build_dir



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In case fortran is needed should be installed with

Mac OS X Mac Ports:
sudo port install gcc46 +gfortran

Also could be necessary to install cmake. In linux do

sudo apt-get install cmake
