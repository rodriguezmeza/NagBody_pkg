NagBody: Installation
################################################################################

Read the correspondig code Readme file in directory Readmes to get installation instructions of a particular NagBody code.

The first steps to do in order to start compiling a NagBody code are:

1. Unpack the code file in your $(HOME):

> unzip nagbody_name_code.tar.gz
> tar xvf nagbody_name_code.tar

2. Move to the NagBody directory:

> cd NagBody_pkg

3. Create directories where binaries and man pages will be located, as well as other useful directories:

> make -f NagBody install_dirs

4. Change to your HOME:

> cd $HOME

5. Modify your profile (it can be ".profile" for Mac OS X or ".bashrc" for Linux):

For a Mac OS X:

> cp .profile profile_nagbody_bak
> cat profile_nagbody_bak NagBody_pkg/env_config/profilerc > .profile

For a Linux:

> cp .bashrc bashrc_nagbody_bak
> cat bashrc_nagbody_bak NagBody_pkg/env_config/profilerc > .bashrc

6. Open a new terminal to refresh your environment. 

7. Change to NagBody directory:

> cd NagBody_pkg

8. Tune the file "Machines/machine.inc" or "Machines/pmachines.inc" in order to use the right compilers and libraries. See in this directory the files in there for several examples. 

For now, in Mac OS X:

> cp Machines/macosx.inc Machines/machine.inc
> cp Machines/p_macosx.inc Machines/pmachine.inc

and for Linux:

> cp Machines/linux.inc Machines/machine.inc
> cp Machines/p_linux.inc Machines/pmachine.inc


Note: I you unpack the file of a NagBody code when you have already unpacked another one, normally overwrite some configuration files, like the ones in the directory "Machines". If you already tune file "Machine/machine.inc" or "Machine/pmachine.inc" to work with your compilers and libraries, then you have to tune the files again or repeat steps as described in 8, above.

9. Now create one binary code, the one you unpacked first. In the Readmes folder there are several Readme files. Readme them to follow the making process. For example, Ònbody_n2Ó:

> make -f NagBody install_nbody_n2

in the ÒbinÓ directory you will have the Ònbody_n2Ó code. Then go to your $HOME directory and make a ÒborrameÓ folder:

> mkdir borrame
> cd borrame
> nbody_n2

Last command run the nbody code and you will see in the terminal some output. Read the manual to see how to use the code:

> man nbody_n2

ThatÕs it.

PLPLOT:

Description of the installation steps for the plplot package needed for the visualization codes and in the readme file in the folder Readmes/Additional_libs.

The plplot libraries are needed to generate nplot2d, analysis_XXX visualization codes.

NOTE: If plplot libraries can be installed using apt-get (linux) or Ports (Mac OS X) or by other means then just make the following link:

> cd $HOME/NagBody_pkg/local
> ln -s /usr plplot

and the steps below are not necesary!! However make sure xwin and eps or ps drivers were installed!!


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In case fortran is needed should be installed with

Mac OS X Mac Ports:
sudo port install gcc46 +gfortran
