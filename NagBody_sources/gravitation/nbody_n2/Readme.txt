Code in C to simulate an N-body system. Computation of force is direct, O(N^2).

Use 

$ man ./doc/nbody_n2.1

to see the manual.

To compile:

cd src
make

To test:

Return to the base code directory and then

cd tests
../src/nbody_n2

Also it will be useful to see all parameters and their default values:

../src/nbody_n2 -help
