!
! THE PROGRAM
! +++++++++++
!
! This programs measures the power spectrum in a 3D simulation using
! Fourier Taylor expansion of some order on the cosine and sine 
! transforms. 
!
! This program is still under development, and deserves further
! optimization to deal with large simulation samples. 
!
! Taylor expansion :
! -------------------
!
! Approximation of zeroth order provides NGP interpolation (Nearest Grid
! Point) while higher order approximations take into account small 
! displacements within cells of the mesh used to perform the Fourier
! transform increasingly accurately. Arbitrarily high order converges
! to the exact transform, namely to the sum
!
! delta_k=\Sum_i M_i exp(I.k.x_i/N), (1)
!
! where x_i is the position of the particle in [0,2.PI[, M_i its mass,
! (total mass of the system unity), k is an integer wavenumber, I^2=-1, 
! and N is the size of the grid used to perform the calculations.
! The power spectrum P_k reads 
!
! P_k=< |delta_k|^2 >_k, 
!
! where <.>_k represents an angular average over the values of k. More 
! exactly, function 
!
! E_k=int(|k|+0.5) 
!
! defines the size of the bin in k space (all k having the same E_k 
! contribute to the same bin).
!
! Folding :
! ---------
!
! To speed up the calculation, it is possible to perform foldings of the
! particle distribution. One folding along one axis consists in replacing
! all the positions veryfing x_i >= PI with x_i-PI, and then multiplying
! all the x_i's (including the unmodified ones) by a factor 2 to span
! again the range [0,2.PI[. This operation is performed on all the
! coordinates. One can then demonstrate that the modes given by 
! equation (1) remain unchanged for even values of k. 
!
! Assuming now that we have a periodic simulation box and that we
! use a grid of fixed size N to perform the calculations, successive
! foldings will allow us to estimate the power spectrum for
! 
! 0 folding  : k=0,1,2,3,4,...,N/2
! 1 folding  : k=2,4,6,8,...,N
! 2 foldings : k=4,8,12,16,...,2N
! 4 foldings : k=8,16,24,32,...,4N
! 
! and so on.
!
! Errors :
! --------
! There are 2 possible sources of errors in the calculation.
!
! (a) the errors due to the finite number of modes sampled in a given
!     bin k. If N_k is the number of independent modes, then the relative 
!     error due to the finiteness of N_k is approximately 
!
!     Delta P_k/P_k=1/sqrt(N_k). (2)
!
!     Obviously Delta P_k/P_k decreases while k increases, since it
!     scales roughly like 1/k.
! 
!     In the code, the number of independent modes, N_k, is output.
!     Another way of estimating the errors is also performed, by
!     simple estimation of the scatter in each bin. It turns out in
!     practice to give errors of the same order of equation (2), which
!     gives the results for an underlying random Gaussian field.
!     Actual calculation of the errors involve non Gaussian terms,
!     so the errors provided by the code are only approximations that
!     should be improved on for really accurate estimates of errorbars.
!
! (b) the biases due to the Taylor expansion and the discreteness of
!     the particle distribution, namely
!     (i) the so called 1/N_part shot noise bias where N_part is the number
!         of particles. In the Fourier Taylor method, this bias is
!         actually slightly different from 1/N_part, but this is estimated
!         accurately by the code. Note that for a slightly perturbed grid
!         pattern, such a bias does not arise and should not be corrected
!         for. Only in a relaxed, locally Poissonian stage, the correction
!         for shot noise makes really sense.
!     (ii) the bias due to the interpolation involved in the calculation.
!         It depends on the order Norder of the Taylor expansion.
!         For example, for NGP, Norder=0, the bias is given by the
!         famous sinc^2(k/2) term. This bias can be easily corrected
!         for at any order. It is performed in the code.
!     (iii) The unknown effects of aliasing of the contributions of the
!         power-spectrum at scales smaller than the sampling imposed
!         by the grid used to perform the calculations. In the limit
!         of a locally Poissonian stationary random process, these effects
!         of aliasing can be bounded. The code computes useful numbers
!         to estimate the maximum effect of aliasing (see Colombi et
!         al. paper for details). The effects of aliasing increase when
!         approaching the nyquist frequency of the sampling grid, so
!         it is wise to stay sufficiently away from the Nyquist frequency
!         to avoid too much aliasing. 
!
! Obviously, by combining foldings and using (a)+(b), one can find
! the best compromise that minimizes the error on the estimate of P_k for  
! a given k at a minimum computational cost. However this is not performed
! at the present stage. 
!
! In its current form, the code computes P(k) for each folding of the particle
! distribution. It computes as well shot noise contribution (b-i), and
! proposes a correction for the biase (b-ii) and usefull numbers for
! estimating (b-iii). Of course, the statistical errors are also estimated,
! (a). It outputs, for each folding, detailed data. However, for practical
! use, a global file contains all the combined information of all the
! foldings and this is what really matter for the user who does not 
! necessarily want to have fully optimal results, but still fairly
! accurate ones. Right now, only that part of the code is fully explained
! in what follows.

! 
! COMPILATION
! +++++++++++
!
! Goto the directory /bin and modify the Makefile according to the
! instructions in it, type make. 
!
! Notes :
! -------
! - The program needs FFTW2, that has to be installed.
!
! - It is possible to use openMP acceleration on shared memory computers,
!   in that case the thread part of FFTW2 has to be properly installed.
!
! - Possible problems of underscore while calling FFTW2, follow the
!   instructions in the Makefile.
!
! - Be aware of the little/big endians problems for input file reading.
!
! - Part of the calculations can be performed in simple precision, which
!   avoids copying arrays and saves significant amount of memory. The
!   compilation option -DSIMPLE can be used in the Makefile to do so.
!   Basically this option inhibits conversion of particle positions and
!   weights to double precision. This option has not been tested
!   sufficiently to be considered as "safe".

!
! EXECUTION
! +++++++++
!
! Create a config file, following the example given in powmes.config, say
! myconfigfile.config. Then type the command
! whereispowmes/powmes myconfigfile.config, where whereispowmes
! is the location of the executable.
! Typing just the command powmes assumes that the name of the config file
! is powmes.config.
!
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
!
! PARAMETERS IN THE CONFIG FILE
! +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
!
! verbose (.true./.false.) : verbose mode
!
! megaverbose (.true./.false.) : detailed verbose mode
!
! filein ('myfile') : name of the input file
!
! nfile (1/2/3) : type of the input file
!     1 : GADGET file
!     2 : 4 columns ascii file :
!         first line : npart where npart is the number of particles 
!         next lines : x(i),y(i),z(i),mass(i) with x,y,z in [0,1[
!     3 : binary file (C format without record length):
!         npart (integer*4)
!         (pos(1:3,j),j=1,npart)
!         (mass(j),j=1,npart) (optional)
!         pos and mass are real*4
!
! nmpi (-1/positive integer) : number of MPI files for nfile=1
!     (this parameter is thus ignored for nfile=2 or nfile=3)
!     set nmpi=-1 if there is only one file
!
! read_mass (.true./.false.) : .true. for reading the mass in the
!         file, .false. for ignoring it and giving the same mass to
!         all the particles. The parameter read_mass is ignored
!         if nfile=1, where all the masses are supposed
!         to be the same for all the particles. WARNING : the code 
!         has not been tested for unequal masses : this is still under
!         development.
!
! nfoldpow (integer) : folding parameter 
!     - if nfoldpow >= 0, it corresponds to the number 
!     of foldings to be performed. Note that the largest value of k 
!     that will be probed will be kmax=k_nyquist*2^(nfoldpow-1), where 
!     k_nyquist is the nyquist frequency of the grid used to perform the 
!     calculations.
!     - if nfoldpow < 0, then kmax=-nfoldpow is the maximum integer
!     wavenumber up to which one wants to measure the power-spectrum.
!     The number of foldings needed to achieve that is computed 
!     automatically.
!
! ngrid (even positive integer): resolution of the grid used to 
!     perform the calculations.
!     ngrid must be an even number (but not necessarily a power of 2).
!
! norder (positive integer): order of the Taylor expansion. 
!     Norder=3 is the recommended value.
!
! shift(float,float,float) : vector corresponding to a constant shift to 
!     be applied to all the particles prior to the calculation. This 
!     can be handy to improve the accuracy of the measurements for a 
!     slightly perturbed grid. shift is expressed in units of the grid
!     cell size.  
!
! filepower ('powspec.dat') : the name of the main output file where all
!                the informations of the measured power-spectrum are gathered
!                in a handy (but not necessarily optimal in terms of signal
!                to noise or biases) way.
!
!     This is a 6 columns ascii file :
!
!     column 1 : the integer wave number 
!     column 2 : the number of statistically independent modes C(k)
!                contributing to the bin k. This number can be useful to
!                compute errorbars : the statistical error
!                on the rough power-spectrum 
!
!                            P_rough(k)=P(k)+1/Npart  
!
!                is, under the Gaussian field hypothesis,  
!
!                           DP_rough(k)/P_rough(k)=1/sqrt(C(k)) (3)
!
!     column 3 : the estimated rough power spectrum PP_rough(k) before 
!                debiasing from Taylor interpolation. 
!     column 4 : the debiased estimated P_rough(k). To obtain the true
!                power-spectrum, one can subtract the white noise contribution
!                (except for a slightly deformed grid, e.g. initial conditions)
!
!                           P(k)=P_rough(k)-W(k)/N_part, (4)
!
!                where W(k) is given by column 5 and is a number very 
!                close to unity. 
!
!     column 5 : the shot noise factor W(k) very close to unity, needed
!                to correct for shot noise contribution the power spectrum
!                given by equation (4).
! 
!     column 6 : the statistical error computed self-consistently from
!                the dispersion inside each k bin.
!                The number displayed is DP_rough(k)/P_rough(k) and
!                should give in practice something very similar to 
!                equation (3). 
!             
! filepower_fold ('powspec'/'#junk') : root name of the output files where 
!     the measurements are stored separately for each folding. If the
!     name of the file starts with a '#", these optional files are not
!     generated. 
!     
!     Example : if filepower_fold='powspec', then 4 files are created :
!
!     powspec.waven  : the wavenumbers          (1st column of filepower)
!     powspec.nmodes : the number of modes file (second column of filepower)
!     powspec.power  : the rough power-spectrum, prior to debiasing 
!                                               (third column of filepower)
!     powspec.powerdebiased : the debiased rough power-spectrum 
!                                               (fourth column of filepower)
!     powspec.shotfac: the shot noise factor W(k), needed to correct
!                      for shot noise contribution when relevant 
!                                               (5th column of filepower)
!     powspec.staterr: the statistical error    (6th column of filepower)
!           
!
!     More specifically :
!
!     powspec.waven : an ascii file with nfoldpow+1 columns, each column 
!           corresponding to a given folding (first column : no fold,
!           second column : 1 fold, etc). In each column, the integer 
!           wavenumber probed by the calculation is written.
!
!           Example : for ngrid=8 and nfoldpow=3 powspec.waven 
!           looks as follows :
!                 
!                 0    0    0    0
!                 1    2    4    8
!                 2    4    8   16
!                 3    6   12   24
!                 4    8   16   32
!
!     powspec.nmodes : similar as powspec.waven, but the number of modes
!           in the corresponding k-bin is output
!
!     powspec.power : similar as powspec.waven, but the measured value of
!           the rough power-spectrum prior to debiasing is written in 
!           each column.
!
!     Similarly for powspec.powerdebiased, powspec.shotfac,powspec.staterr.
!
! filetaylor ('powspec.taylor'/'#junk') : name of the file containing
!     useful informations for the fourier-taylor calculation. This file
!     is optional and is not output if the name starts with a '#'.
!     This is a multicolumn ascii file, each line corresponds to an
!     integer value of k, starting from 0.
!
!     Column 1 : the number of independent modes C(k)
!     Column 2 : an estimate of L(k)=W(k)*U(k) where U(k) is explained 
!                below
!     Column 3 : approximation for L(k) valid at small k
!     Column 4 : the estimated bias U(k) on the rough power spectrum
!                Basically, debiasing the power-spectrum (i.e. passing
!                from column 3 to column 4 of filepower) consists in
!                multiplying the rough power-spectrum by 1/U(k)
!     Column 5 : The W(k) already mentionned earlier.
