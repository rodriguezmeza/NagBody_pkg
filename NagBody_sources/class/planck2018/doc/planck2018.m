libraries that allow to compute the log likelihoods of the temperature,
polarization and lensing maps. Optionally, it also provides a python version of
this library, as well as tools to modify the predetermined options for some
likelihoods (changing the high-ell and low-ell lmin and lmax of the temperature).
