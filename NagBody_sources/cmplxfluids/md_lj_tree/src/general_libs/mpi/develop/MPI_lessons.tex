How to Run MPICH2 Programs in a Batch Queue
Example of Submitting to discovery PBS batch queue

 Here is an example of a script that you can use to submit a job to the PBS batch queue. Use the command qsub to submit the file to the PBS batch queue. Use the command qstat job# where the job number is the number that was returned by the qsub command. Use the showq command to see the jobs in the PBS batch queue.

The batch queue determines which processors your job runs on. 


discovery:~> cat sample_pbs_script
# start up bash script as if it were a login shell
#!/bin/bash -l 
# declare a name for this job to be sample_job
#PBS -N hello_world 
# request the default queue for this job
#PBS -q default
# request a total of 8 processors for this job (2 nodes and 4 processors per node)
#PBS -l nodes=2:ppn=4
# request 1 hour of wall time
#PBS -l walltime=1:00:00
# specify your email address so mail can be sent to when the job is finished
#PBS -M John.Smith@dartmouth.edu
# have email sent to you when the job is finished
#PBS -m ae 
#change to the directory where you submitted the job 
cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR
#include the full path to the name of your MPI program
