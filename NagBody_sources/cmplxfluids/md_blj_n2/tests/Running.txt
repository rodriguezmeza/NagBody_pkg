STOPPING THE CODE
       Once the md_blj_n2 is running you may always stop it by executing the command

       echo > stop

       You must be in the same directory were the process were lunched.  A file named 'stop-state' is saved containing
       the state of the simulation run. This option permits us to stop the simulation and change some numerical and/or
       physical parameters such as temperature or density.

EXAMPLES
       Executing

       md_blj_n2

       will run the default simulation which is consistent with the experimental data reported in: J.L. Yarnell, et al,
       "Structure factor and radial distribution function for liquid Argon at 85 K", Phys. Rev. A7 (1972) 2130.
       Parameter eps in the Lennard-Jones potential that fit the experimental data is eps/kB = 119 K.

       With the command: md_blj_n2 nbody=4096 out=snap%03d dtout=2/256

       we run a simulation with 4096 bodies and save snap data every other time step.

       With the command: md_blj_n2 statefile=state

       we run a simulation were a state file is saved every dtout/dtime steps. If for some reasons the simulation run
       is interrupted you may always restart the run ejecuting the command:

       md_blj_n2 restorefile=state

       Or if you stop it the run using the command 'echo > stop' you may restart the run with the command:

       md_blj_n2 restorefile=stop-state

       Ejecuting the command:

       md_blj_n2 icModel=6 nbodyprop=2/2 tstop=100 d=0.8 o=snap stepvAvg=30 > output &

       a run is launched in the background using an FCC initial condition whose basic cell has 2/2 bodies proportion
       with a density=0.8, snaps will be saved every 5 time steps and properties will be computed every 30 steps.

       Now, we may stop the simulation using 'echo > stop', then we re-launch the simulation using the command:

       md_blj_n2 restore=stop-state stepAvg=70 > output01 & Therefore, properties are now computed every 70 time steps


ANIMATIONS
       You may run the analysis_md code to see animation plots.  Run a simulation using, for example, the command:

       md_blj_n2 icModel=6 nbodyprop=2/2 tstop=100 d=0.8 o=snap > output &
       then, use the command:

       analysis_md in=snap analysis_type=snap-anim

       to see the animation of the simulation. Instead of <snap-anim> you may use <snap-animtrajectory> to see the
       trajectories of the particles.  If you want to distiguish the type of particles use also options=<types>.

       The x and y ranges may change according to particle positions during simulation, then, can be useful to set
       xrange=<xmin:xmax> and xrange=<ymin:ymax>.

       Then you may execute the command:

       analysis_md in=snap analysis_type=snap-animtrajectory options=type withsymbols=false wd=true xr=-4.5:4.5
       yr=-4.5:4.5 fsnap=20

       to see trajectory animation distinguishing particles types with a x and y ranges fix and showning up to 20 snaps
       in total.
