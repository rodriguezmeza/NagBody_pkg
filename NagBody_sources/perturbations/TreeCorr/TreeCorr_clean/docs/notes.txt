This file just contains some notes to myself about various things.

Checklist for making a new release:

- Run test suite on as many machines as possible.
- Make sure debugging output is turned off.
- Update the version number to the new M.m.r value in _version.py
- Read over the CHANGELOG.rst file and edit as needed.
- Update the wiki pages to incorporate any changes as needed.
- Update any docs that might need updating.
- git checkout -b releases/M.m  (if necessary)
- git push -u origin releases/M.m
- python setup.py install  (make sure this is current)
- In docs directory, run update_docs
- Commit new docs in releases/M.m branch as single commit.
- Cherry-pick docs commit onto main and push there.
- Now, back on releases/M.m branch...
- git tag -a vM.m.r -m vM.m.r
- git push --tags
- Delete the TreeCorr.egg-info directory (in case has extra files)
- python setup.py sdist
- Inspect the dist/TreeCorr-M.m.r.tar.gz tarball to make sure it is accurate.
- twine upload dist/TreeCorr-M.m.r.tar.gz
- From another directory try out pip install TreeCorr --upgrade

If major release:
- Back in main, update version number to M.(m+1) (i.e. no .r)
- Add tagged CHANGELOG blob to the history page in the docs.
- Clear out CHANGELOG.rst
- Change github home page to point to releases/M.m
- Also change the Pages to point to releases/M.m
